# [420. Strong Password Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker)

### Solution:
```swift
class Solution {
    func strongPasswordChecker(_ password: String) -> Int {
        let arr = Array(password), c = arr.count
        var low = false, up = false, num = false
        arr.forEach({
            if $0.isLowercase { low = true }
            else if $0.isUppercase { up = true }
            else if $0.isNumber { num = true }
        })
        var types = 3
        if low { types -= 1 }
        if up { types -= 1 }
        if num { types -= 1 }
        
        var one = 0, two = 0, rep = 0, i = 2
        while i < c {
            if arr[i] == arr[i-1] && arr[i] == arr[i-2] {
                var l = 2
                while i < c && arr[i] == arr[i-1] {
                    l += 1
                    i += 1
                }
                rep += l / 3
                if l % 3 == 0 { one += 1 }
                else if l % 3 == 1 { two += 1 }
            } else {
                i += 1
            }
        }
        if c < 6 {
            return max(types, 6 - c)
        } else if c <= 20 {
            return max(types, rep)
        }
        let del = c - 20
        rep -= min(del, one)
        rep -= (min(max(del - one, 0), two * 2) / 2)
        rep -= (max(del - one - 2 * two, 0) / 3)
        return max(types, rep) + del
    }
}

### Description:

A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:

* It has at least ```6``` characters and at most ```20``` characters.
* It contains at least **one lowercase** letter, at least **one uppercase** letter, and at least **one digit**.
* It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., ```"...aaa..."``` is weak, but ```"...aa...a..."``` is strong, assuming other conditions are met).

Given a string ```password```, return the minimum number of steps required to make ```password``` strong. if ```password``` is already strong, return ```0```.

In one step, you can:

* Insert one character to ```password```,
* Delete one character from ```password```, or
* Replace one character of ```password``` with another character.

#### Example 1:
```swift
Input: password = "a"
Output: 5
```

#### Example 2:
```swift
Input: password = "aA1"
Output: 3
```

#### Example 3:
```swift
Input: password = "1337C0d3"
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:
```swift
1 <= password.length <= 50
password consists of letters, digits, dot '.' or exclamation mark '!'.
